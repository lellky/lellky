# Congratulations, you found it!

You weren't supposed to be here. And yet, here you are.

What led you to this page? A stray link? A buried reference? A whisper in the code?

### The Net is Everywhere
In 1995, Angela Bennett stumbled upon a secret she was never meant to see. A hidden backdoor, a simple symbolâ€”Pi, inside a circle. A gateway to control. And when she found it, they erased her life.

Data is power. Identity is fragile. And the deeper you dig, the more you risk becoming part of the system you seek to uncover.

### Are You Being Watched?
Every click, every query, every interaction leaves a trace. You think you're anonymous, but the Net remembers. The Net learns. The Net adapts.

The only way to stay safe is to stay unseen. But you've already crossed that line.

### What Happens Next?
That depends on you. Close this page and forget you ever found it? Or dig deeper, knowing that knowledge comes at a cost?

The choice is yours. But remember: once you're in, there's no turning back.
