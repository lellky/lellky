## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jonas, better known as lellky, a father of two with a passion for technology, electronics, and all things HiFi. When I'm not tinkering with code or audio gear, you'll likely find me enjoying the outdoors â€” fly fishing or camping in breathtaking locations. I also love to travel and explore new places.

I'm the maintainer of the [Flexit BACnet](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/flexit_bacnet/) integration for Home Assistant, helping smart home enthusiasts get the most out of their HVAC systems.
